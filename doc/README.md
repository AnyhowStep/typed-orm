### TypeScript Version Compatibility

Note that this library was written for TypeScript 3.5.1

It is very unlikely that this library will work with older or newer versions of TypeScript
without tweaks.

Each new version of TypeScript generally makes breaking changes to the type system,
whether they are new features, bug fixes, or even new bugs.

These changes to the type system are generally [not backported](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/38237).

Therefore, a complex-enough TypeScript library will find it very difficult to support more than one TypeScript version.
